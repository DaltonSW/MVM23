dialogues: 
    - name: Dalton
      paragraphs: 
        - This is the first line of dialogue. It will be read in and processed.
        - For every additional line of dialogue, you'll put it on a new line with a hyphen
        - You need to make sure that each of these lines fits within a single textbox. I'll provide specifics when I have them
    - name: Patrick
      paragraphs:
        - As you can see, the strings are entirely unquoted. You can just type them
    - name: David
      paragraphs:
        - Each list item can have multiple elements. This is exemplified here.
        - Note that there is only a hyphen before "name" and not before "paragraphs". This indicates they're part of the same list item
